The global push for enhanced oil recovery and the rehabilitation of aging oil wells have intensified the need for slickline services. In 2023, the market was valued at approximately <strong>$2.4 billion</strong>, and it is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>4.5%</strong> from 2024 to 2032.
